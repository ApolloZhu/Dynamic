*Dynamic Dark Mode* is the app you are looking for to power up Dark Mode on macOS Mojave.

Instead of looking for the switch for dark mode in System Preferences, just click the icon in the menu bar. Ever felt your eyes getting hurt because the screen is so bright in the night? Have to worry no more, we Dynamically enable dark mode in dim lights, after sunset, or just anytime. When you wake up in the morning, it'll a be another bright day.

## Install

### Latest Release

[Dynamic Dark Mode v1.0 (6) Release Page](https://github.com/ApolloZhu/Dynamic-Dark-Mode/releases/tag/1.0.6)

OR install with `brew cask install dynamic`

### Mac App Store
Apple will not include *Dynamic Dark Mode* on the Mac App Store because they believe it to be in violation of their application guidelines: specifically, it changes a System Preference. Since that's exactly what *Dynamic Dark Mode* is written to do, it's unlikely to be included on the Mac App Store unless Apple changes their policy. For easy installation and updates, use Homebrew.

## Usage

- Click the menu bar icon to toggle Dark Mode
- Right click the menu bar icon to show settings
